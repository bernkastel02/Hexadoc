# Hexadoc
An extremely easy document bot.

Literally, extremely easy.

After pulling, run `npm install`. After that, open `doc.js` and input your token at the bottom.

To add docs, just follow the example:

```
{
    "functionName": "test",
    "functionArguments": [
        "test",
        "test",
        "test"
    ],
    "functionDescription": "This is made to test the documents command!"
}
```

Thats it. Seriously.
